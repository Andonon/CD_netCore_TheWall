    The Wall
Now that we have created an assignment where a user can register and login to our site, let's combine this idea with our previous messaging assignment "Quoting Dojo". Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users. Store the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database. Have a Login and Registration page. After logging in, the user is directed to The Wall.

Download the handout for the wireframe/ERD (http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_2640/handouts/chapter2640_3286_wireframe-wall.png)

Once you got the messages to show up like on the wireframe on the left side, allow users to post comments for any message. Store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments'.

<ul>
<li>Extra Credit I (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message.</li>
<li>Extra Credit II (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message but only if the message was made in the last 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>

Finish the assignment and upload your code below.
